# Pinterest Data Pipeline **WIP**

## Brief
Pinterest crunches billions of data points every day to decide how to provide more value to their users. This project will be to create a similar system using the AWS Cloud.

## Description
As part of the AI Core Data Engineering Bootcamp, this initiative highlights the development of two distinct data pipelines: one for batch processing and another for stream processing. Leveraging various AWS services including API Gateway, Managed Services for Kafka (MSK), S3, Databricks (Spark), and more, the project illustrates a comprehensive approach to data ingestion, transformation, and storage. Specifically tailored to handle sample Pinterest data stored on a user account within the AWS environment, generously provided by the bootcamp, the pipelines aim to generate query-ready data upon completion. This undertaking not only serves as a practical learning experience encompassing diverse data engineering practices and technologies but also stands as a valuable reference for those venturing into the field.
